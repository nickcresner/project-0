## Description

Do you think you know your city better than your friends? City Clickers challenges you to prove it. 

My first GA Javascript project is a map orientated two player trivia game in which the users have to click on the map where they think the famous (or not so famous) landmarks are situated. 

Firstly the users decide which city to test themselves on- then they choose the difficulty.

Rounds are split into catergories such as landmarks, stations, sporting venues and squares/plazas which become available depending on which city is selected. 

## How to play

- Choose a city from the drop-down
- Select a category/difficulty
- Click to begin the game
- Player one guesses where they think the landmarks are situated
- Player two then takes their guess
- The target location will then be revealed and the scores will be added up based on who clicks closer to the correct answer location. 

##Technologies Used

- HTML 5
- SCSS
- JavaScript ES6
- jQuery 3.10
- Gulp
- NPM
- Git & github


### Challenges faced

As this was my first so Javascript project I faced significant challenges in understanding the language and syntax and translating that into workable code for my game. 

I learned how to use the page.click x and y functions and converted those into percentages so that my game works on different sized screens. 

###Improvements and wishlist

- Refactoring
- Namespacing
- Scrollable and zoomable maps
- A round for everyone in the class's hometown
- Customisable icons for the map pins
- Change Player One/Player Two to the users name
- Cryptic clues involving working out problems or trivia to reveal a location
